If you want to be able to generate your own `milligram.css` from the SASS templates,
install dart-sass by simply downloading and extracting the binaries from https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/releases here. The resulting subdirectory hierarchy looks like this:

```
$ find                                                                                 elm-logs-viewer/git/master 
.
./dart-sass
./src
./src/SASS_LICENSE
./src/DART_LICENSE
./src/dart
./src/sass.dart.snapshot
./sass
```
